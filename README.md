# AMLO - Natural Language Processing Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis of the natural language processing of the Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO). The analysis is based on the speeches and press conferences of the president that are uploaded everyday to his own [website](src/amlo_scraper/scrape_amlo.py).

I created an 'aggressivity score' to measure how hostile he is on his morning conferences. For this, my team and me created a small dataset and extracted the 'aggressive sentences' from the speeches. 

### 1. Scraping the data

The data was scraped from the official website of the Mexican President.

### 4. NLP Analysis

We implemented some cleaning and preprocessing techniques to the data....

We created a custom model using a neural network, this model was trained using the 'manual scores' we computed.

### 4. Results
